## Exercise 4 ##

### Task 1 Clap switch ###
Here I failed for some reason. I managed to make the microphone to work, relay to switch and the LED to illuminate. But somehow the microphone line had strange readings with interference from the relay. It was getting random ghost inputs switching the relay on off. This was exaggerated with the unreliable wiring with the relay. After some time debugging I gave up as I was running out of time. Connecting the relay was a nightmare so I got frustrated with disconnecting wires.
