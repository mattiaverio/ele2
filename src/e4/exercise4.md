## Exercise 4 ##

### Task 1 Clap switch ###
Here I failed for some reason. I managed to make the microphone to work. But somehow the microphone line had strange readings with interference from the relay. After some time debugging I gave up as I was running out of time. Connecting the relay was a nightmare so I got frustrated with disconnecting wires.

### Task 3 Temperature & humidity ###
Only a done. Simple reading using Adafruit library.

### Task 4 LED over Wi-Fi ###
Will be completed later.
